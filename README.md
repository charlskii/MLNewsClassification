This repository contains two complementary data science projects focused on understanding political bias and sentiment in online news headlines through natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

The first project explores how sentiment in news headlines varies across political ideologies, using visualisation techniques to uncover emotional trends over time.
The second project applies supervised machine learning models to classify news headlines by political alignment—liberal, moderate, or conservative—based on linguistic features.
Together, these projects aim to improve transparency in media consumption and highlight the interplay between language, ideology, and emotion in news reporting.
